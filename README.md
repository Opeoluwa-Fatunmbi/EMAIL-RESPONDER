# EMAIL-RESPONDER

In this script, the smtplib library is used to connect to the email server (in this case, Gmail) and send the email.
The MIMEText class from the email library is used to create the message to be sent.
The login method is used to log in to the email server, and the sendmail method is used to send the email.
The script ends by quitting the connection to the email server.
